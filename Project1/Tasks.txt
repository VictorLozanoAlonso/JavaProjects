Task 1:
Design a class named MaxLocation for locating a maximal value and its location in a two- dimensional array. The class must contain three data fields
• Row (used to store the row indices of a two-dimensional array)
• Column (used to store the column indices of a two-dimensional array)
• maxValue (used to store the maximum value in the two-dimensional array)
Choose appropriate datatypes for all the data fields.
Write a method that returns the location of the largest element in a two-dimensional array. The return value should be an instance of MaxLocation class.
Your program that prompts the user to enter a two-dimensional array and displays the location of the largest element in the array.
Here is a sample run:
Enter the number of rows and columns in the array: 3 4

Enter the array:
23.5 35 2 10
4.5 3 45 3.5
35 44 5.5 9.6

The location of the largest element is 45 at (1, 2)

Task 2:
This task is required to create Craps, which is a popular dice game played in casinos. You are supposed to write a program to play a variation of the game, as follows:
• Roll two dice. (Each roll should produce two random numbers between 1 to 6)
• Each die has six faces representing values 1, 2, ..., and 6, respectively.
• Check the sum of the two dice. If the sum is 2, 3, or 12 (your program should display
craps), you lose the game.
• If the sum of the two dice is 7 or 11 (your program should display naturals), you win the
game.
• If the sum of two dice is any value (i.e., 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10), your program should establish
a point in the game (meaning store that sum). Continue to roll the dice until the sum is either a 7 or the same point value which was established. If rolled sum is 7, you lose the game. Otherwise, if the rolled sum is equal to established point you win.

Your program acts as a single player.

 You rolled 5 + 6 = 11 Congratulations, You win
 You rolled 1 + 2 = 3
Craps, Better Luck Next Time, You lose
 You rolled 4 + 4 = 8
Point is (established) set to 8 You rolled 5 + 1 = 6
You rolled 1 + 1 = 2
You rolled 6 + 2 = 8 Congratulations, You Win
 You rolled 5 + 1 = 6
Point is (established) set to 6
You rolled 2 + 5 = 7
Craps, Better Luck Next Time, You Lose
